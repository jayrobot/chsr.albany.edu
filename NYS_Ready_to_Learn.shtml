			      <h1>New York State: Ready to Learn Evaluation</h1>

			      <p class="intro"><a href="http://shop.wmht.org/shop/home.php" target="_blank">WMHT  Educational Telecommunications</a>, in partnership with the <a href="http://www.nysed.gov/" target="_blank">New York State Education  Department</a>, and with the support of nine other New York public television stations,  launched the <a href="http://www.thirteen.org/readytolearn/about.html" target="_blank">New York State: Ready to Learn (NYS: RTL</a>) initiative. CHSR conducted an evaluation with  the  goal of establishing statewide procedural guidelines and  recommendations for stations that will be implementing RTL in the future. </p>

			      <p>Ready to Learn service provides parents, teachers, and caregivers in New York's  Tri-state area with public television resources that help children develop a  lifelong love of learning. RTL provides on-air, online, and print  resources, as well as community outreach designed to help get young children  ready for success in school. Participating agencies convened a planning coalition to assess,  align, and integrate RTL digital media products and services into  early childhood education across New York State. </p>

                  <p>Expected  outcomes included development and piloting of a plan to integrate RTL resources into early education settings, increased commitment of childcare  staff and early education teachers to professional development, and stronger  parent support for the integration of RTL products in learning environments.</p>

                  </h2>

                  <p>The  evaluation of NYS: RTL was primarily process-oriented with the major goal of  establishing statewide procedural guidelines and recommendations for stations  that will be implementing RTL in the future. The principal activity of interest  was training workshops conducted by stations to promote RTL with teachers,  parents, and other community members. Essential elements of the evaluation are  described in chronological order below:</p>

                  <ol>

                    <li> Each  station defined in writing a <strong>target population</strong> for its pilot project as  specifically as possible. Shared information included whether services were  geared for teachers, early childcare professionals, parents, libraries, and/or other  community agencies. </li>

                    <li><strong>Needs  Assessment:</strong> Before conducting RTL workshops, a brief survey was administered to  assess the needs and concerns of prospective attendees, as well as their level  of familiarity with RTL. CHSR designed prototype surveys to give stations flexibility to add questions to address unique needs. </li>

                    <li><strong>Training  Evaluation:</strong> Workshop evaluation forms were distributed at the conclusion of the  workshops so that attendees could report immediate thoughts and impressions.  These forms were created and distributed by CHSR, based on input from a  project workgroup.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Pre and post workshop  surveys were designed to assess strengths and weaknesses of each stationâ€™s approach  to planning and conducting RTL. The RTL evaluation involved analyses of  responses to these surveys. In general, participants across audience types  responded favorably to the workshops and reported that they were likely to  incorporate RTL resources into home and classroom activities. </p>
