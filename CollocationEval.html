						      <h1>The NYS Collocation Demonstration Project</h1>

				  <p class="intro">A joint  initiative from <a href="http://www.oasas.state.ny.us/" target="_blank">Office of Alcohol and  Substance Abuse</a> and O<a href="http://www.ocfs.state.ny.us/main/">ffice of Children and Families Services</a>, the New York State Collocation Demonstration Project addressed  substance abuse problems among families investigated for child maltreatment.The initiative aimed to improve screening of substance abuse  problems, early identification of substance abusing parents and PINS, timely  referral and engagement and retention in treatment programs. The project  was successfully implemented in 8 upstate counties (Dutchess, Fulton, Genesee, Livingston, Onondaga, Orange, St. Lawrence,  and Westchester). The program ran  for approximately 2 years but ended prematurely due to state budget cuts.</p>

								

				  <p><strong class="purple_bold">CHSR’s Evaluation and  Project Database</strong><br />

CHSR was responsible for designing and implementing the  project database and for overall evaluation. A web-based database was developed  to assist program sites and state staff to monitor performance and identity  problems early on. The database was linked by the family so the family’s  progress could be tracked over time.  In  addition, the database allowed the project staff and administrator to get  reports on caseload and assessment results for a given period (month). The CHSR  conducted a process evaluation which culminated into a final report (link the  final report after OCFS approval). The process evaluation was consisted of two  components. First, the evaluation team conducted interviews and focus groups with  frontline workers as well as with project leaders at each program site.  The second part was a cohort study using program  data extracted from the project database. </p>

                  <p><span class="purple_bold">The Collocation Pilot Study</span><br />

                  CHSR was  awarded an evaluation grant from Children’s  Bureau, Administration of Children and Family,  Department of Health and Human Services (Grant #90-CW-1111).  The  study’s aim was to examine the pilot collocation program. The pilot collocation  program was one of models to address parental substance abuse among child  welfare populations funded through TANF prevention monies in New York State.  Substance treatment agencies were eligible to apply for the funding in  partnership with child welfare offices in their region. In 2001, nine programs  began to serve child welfare clients and the pilot programs ended in most sites  by 2004. </p>

<p>The  evaluation focused on the implementation of the model and included seven sites;  four programs in primarily rural locations and three programs in New York  City.  The <a href="Publications/Collocation_2009.pdf" target="_blank">findings of this study</a>  are encouraging with regards to the possible impact of the collocation model on  coordination of services between the child welfare and substance abuse systems.  The study recommends that given the dearth of evidence-based programs in child  welfare, any innovative interventions developed to serve the child welfare  families should be evaluation and pilot-tested before large-scale  implementation. </p>
