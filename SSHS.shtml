						      <h1>Safe Schools/Healthy Students Evaluation</h1>

				  <p class="intro">The <a href="http://www.ed.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Education</a>, <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/" target="_blank">Department of Health and Human Services</a>, and <a href="http://www.justice.gov/" target="_blank">Department of Justice</a> awarded the <a href="http://www.albanyschools.org/" target="_blank">City School District of Albany (CSDA)</a> a competitive $6 million grant to support school-based mental health and juvenile justice services. CHSR assisted the CSDA in writing the grant, designed and continues to execute the program evaluations, and developed and continues to maintain a data management system. </p>

								

				  <p>The <a href="http://www.sshs.samhsa.gov/" target="_blank">Safe Schools/Healthy Students (SS/HS) initiative</a> in  Albany is known as <a href="http://www.albanyschools.org/district/Programs/A-PLUS.htm" target="_blank">A-PLUS (Albany Partnership for Learning and Uniting  Services)</a>. A-PLUS is designed to improve academic outcomes by reorganizing and  expanding high quality, comprehensive school and community-based services so  that students may learn, live, and prosper in safe and supportive environments. </p>

                  <p>Under the SS/HS initiative, school districts must partner  with local agencies to implement a comprehensive, community-wide plan. The plan  includes the implementation of new full-service mental health clinics at <a href="http://www.ahs.albany.k12.ny.us/" target="_blank">Albany  High School</a> and <a href="http://www.albanyschools.org/Schools/northalbany/nrthalb.htm" target="_blank">North Albany Academy</a>, and select services focusing on the following five elements:</p>

                  <ul>

                    <li>Safe school  environments and violence prevention activities</li>

                    <li>Alcohol, tobacco, and  other drug prevention activities <br />

                    </li>

                    <li>Student behavioral,  social, and emotional supports <br />

                    </li>

                    <li>Mental health  services<br />

                    </li>

                    <li>Early childhood  social and emotional learning programs<br />

                    </li>

                  </ul>

                  <h2>
                  Evaluation &amp; Research</h2>

<p>CHSR designed and implemented the Safe Schools/Healthy  Students evaluation protocol. Using multiple methods of data collection and  analysis, the evaluation is designed to ensure that evidence-based programs are  delivered with fidelity. All major stakeholders contribute data to provide a  comprehensive picture of program strengths and weaknesses. Evaluators  synthesize information and report findings to a local SS/HS Board and Steering  Committee. Documentation of effective practices and procedures will help  sustain A-PLUS beyond the four years of grant funding.</p>

                  <p>Evaluations of existing full-service school models  demonstrate positive impacts on student, family, school, and community well-being.Â Benefits to students include more positive  attitudes and behaviors, increased access to services, and earlier  identification of needs. Families benefit from reduced stress. Full service  schools are safer and show improved test scores. Finally, communities  experience reduced crime and violence and more cost-effective and timely  services due to better interagency communication. </p><h2>Program Development</h2>
<p>CHSR prepared the  successful grant application following an extensive community needs assessment. CHSR  convened a planning committee consisting of representatives from the school district;  the Albany County Department for Children, Youth &amp; Families; the Albany County Department of Probation; the Albany Police  Department; Families Together in Albany County; the Department of Youth and Workforce  Services; Parsons Child &amp; Family Center; the University at Albany; and parents and  students. </p>

                  <p>Dr. Kenneth Robin, Senior Research Scientist and SSW Assistant  Research Professor, serves on the A-PLUS Core Management Team  and Advisory Board. This level of involvement facilitates an ongoing feedback  loop that informs service modifications and improvements. Dr. Robin is also  involved with other CSDA grant programs and initiatives, which helps improve  service coordination and integration. Strengthening ties between A-PLUS and  existing district and community programs promotes a comprehensive and  sustainable network of child and family supports. </p>
                  <h2>Systems &amp; Software Development</h2>
                  <p>CHSR designed a customized web-based Management Information  System (MIS) to track services offered at two school-based mental health  clinics. Students and families receive both group and individual services from  staff that includes a clinical social worker, behavior specialist, parent  partner, and youth advocate. Clinic activities are tracked so that individual,  family, and group histories can be compiled, and providers can review both the  nature and intensity of services delivered. The Safe Schools/Healthy Students MIS includes  automated reporting features and is linked to relevant student data in <a href="http://www.pearsonschoolsystems.com/products/powerschool/" title="PowerSchool" target="_blank">PowerSchool</a>, the primary source of student information used by the city  schools.</p>
