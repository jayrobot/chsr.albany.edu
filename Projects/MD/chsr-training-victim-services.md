**Training Needs of Victime Service Providers**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) was contracted by
theÂ [**New York State Office of Victim Services**](https://ovs.ny.gov/),
to conduct an assessment of the training needs of victim service
providers throughout New York State.

Evaluation & Research

CHSR conducted a needs assessment consisting of an online survey of
service providers and telephone interviews with key stakeholders to:

-   ascertain the basic skills that victim service providers needed to
    provide quality assistance, services, and support to victims and
    survivors of crime;

-   specify the types of training and topics needed to improve victim
    services;

-   identify specific modalities and delivery methods of training for
    victim service providers; and

-   determine the sustainability of training efforts over time.
