**E-MDT Initiative Preliminary Evaluation**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR), in collaboration with the
University at Albany School of Social Welfare, partnered
with [**[Lifespan of Greater
Rochester]{.underline}**](https://www.lifespan-roch.org/enhanced-multidisciplinary-teams) and
the [**[Weill Cornell Medicine's New York City Elder Abuse
Center]{.underline}**](https://nyceac.org/clinical-services/mdts/) to
perform a preliminary program evaluation of the Elder Abuse
Interventions and Enhanced Multidisciplinary Team (E-MDT) Initiative in
New York State. The preliminary program evaluation was funded by the New
York State [**Office for Aging**](https://aging.ny.gov/) and the New
York State [**Office of Victim Services**](https://ovs.ny.gov/).

E-MDTs used a collaborative approach to intervene in complex cases of
elder abuse (e.g., financial, physical, psychological, sexual, and
neglect by others). Members of the teams represented a variety of
disciplines including Adult Protective Services, aging services, health
and human services, financial/banking services, law enforcement, and
others who meet under the facilitation of an E-MDT Coordinator. The
teams were enhanced by access to forensic accountants, geriatric
psychiatrists/mental health professionals, and civil legal services.

Evaluation & Research

In Year 1, CHSR established a baseline efficacy of the program in New
York State through interviews and surveys with representatives in a
variety of roles within the E-MDTs. In subsequent projects years, CHSR
provided additional support for program efficacy through an additional
survey and focus groups targeting E-MDT ancillary staff.
