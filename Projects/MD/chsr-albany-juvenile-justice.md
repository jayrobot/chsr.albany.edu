**Albany County Juvenile Justice Coordination and Research**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) worked with the [**[Albany
County Department for Children, Youth, and
Families]{.underline}**](http://www.albanycounty.com/cyf/) to provide
data collection and analysis for research centered furthering the goals
of the Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative (JDAI) through
community engagement and interagency collaboration..

JDAI began in Albany in 2013 and aimed to reduce juvenile detention
admissions and expand the array of local detention alternatives,
minimize re-arrest and failure to appear rates pending adjudication, and
reduce racial and ethnic disparities in juvenile detention.

Evaluation & Research

CHSR worked with local agencies to identify and utilize data in making
policy and case-level decisions and in developing strategies to improve
the local juvenile justice system. Data pertaining to juvenile justice
processes and alternatives to detention were collected, analyzed, and
presented to local stakeholders.
