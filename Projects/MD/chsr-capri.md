**Capital Area Poverty Reduction Initiative**

**(CAPRI)**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) worked with [**[CARES,
Inc.]{.underline}**](https://caresny.org/) to conduct an evaluation of
the Capital Area Poverty Reduction Initiative (CAPRI). This program was
funded by The City of Albany after receipt of a \$1.5 million [**[Empire
State Poverty Reduction
Initiative]{.underline}**](https://nyscommunityaction.org/nyscaa-public-policy/empire-state-poverty-reduction-initiative-and-community-action/) (ESPRI)
grant to develop a plan to reduce poverty in Albany.

A main focus of the grant was to increase employment among adults in
vulnerable populations residing in the City of Albany. The evaluation
included:

-   a review of secondary data sources to report on demographics and
    employment trends;

-   a literature and document review to identify best practices,
    available vocational assessment tools, and outcome measures;

-   development of a project-specific database;

-   interviews with local stakeholders; and

-   administration of electronic surveys to participants.

The project provided a data brief on demographics and needs, a data
brief on the local employment landscape, a report on best practices and
model programs, and a report summarizing participation and outcomes.
