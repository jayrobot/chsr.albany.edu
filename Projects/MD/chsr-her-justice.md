**Her Justice Evaluation**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) was contracted to serve as
the lead evaluator on a grant awarded to [**[Her
Justice]{.underline}**](http://www.herjustice.org/) from the [**[New
York Community Trust]{.underline}**](http://www.nycommunitytrust.org/).
The grant focused on determining the impact of services received on
legal and extra-legal outcomes of low-income women seeking free legal
services in family, divorce, and immigration law.

Evaluation & Research

CHSR measured the relative impact of legal services coordinated and
provided by Her Justice to low-income women in the areas of family,
divorce, and immigration law. The efficacy of Pro Se support and full
legal services were compared. The analysis considered their relative
impacts on both legal outcomes, such as custody decisions or child
support amounts, and non-legal outcomes such as subsequent employment
and satisfaction with the legal process.
