**Healthy Families New Jersey**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) developed a customized
web-based application for [**[Healthy Families New Jersey
(HFNJ)]{.underline}**](http://www.healthyfamiliesnj.org/).

HFNJ is based on the Healthy Families America model, a research-based,
nationally accredited home visitation program designed to promote
positive childhood outcomes and family functioning. In 2008, New Jersey
merged its Healthy Families Program (HF) with the TANF Initiative for
Parents (TIP) Program, thereby making the Healthy Families
research-based model available to TANF recipients. There are 22 Healthy
Families‐TIP (HF‐TIP) Programs throughout the state of New Jersey.

Evaluation & Research

CHSR worked collaboratively with Prevent Child Abuse New Jersey to
revise the Program Information Management System (PIMS) data collection
system for the new web-based application. CHSR programmed the
application, which required converting data from the old system to the
new system, and also trained users and provided technical support. The
new system was designed to meet the administrative, programmatic,
reporting, and evaluation needs of HF-TIP. The web-based system allowed
managers and workers to analyze and advance practice through
comprehensive data collection capacity and sophisticated reporting
mechanisms.
