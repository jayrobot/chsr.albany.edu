**OPWDD Direct Care Employee Trust Survey**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) worked with the New York
State [**Office for People with Developmental Disabilities
(OPWDD)**](https://opwdd.ny.gov/)Â to examine the challenges faced by
direct care employees working with people with developmental
disabilities. This research specifically focused on state-run services,
which comprised approximately 20 percent of all services provided.

OPWDD coordinated services for more than 126,000 New Yorkers with
developmental disabilities by providing services both directly and
through a network of approximately 700 non-profit service providers
throughout the state.

Evaluation & Research

CHSR conducted a mail and web-based worker survey and a series of worker
focus groups to obtain insights and perceptions of direct care staff.
Both methods focused on employee skills and support in dealing with
safety issues facing their clients.
