**My Brother's Keeper**

CHSR worked with [**[City School District of
Albany]{.underline}**](http://www.albanyschools.org/) to evaluate a My
Brother's Keeper Challenge Grant (MBKCG) awarded to the school district
which aimed to prioritize initiatives designed to ensure young boys of
color entered school ready to learn, read at grade level by third grade,
and grew up in safe communities.

This grant was designed to encourage regions and school districts to
develop and execute coherent cradle-to-career college strategies that
aimed at improving the life outcomes for boys and young men of color.

MBKCGs were part of a federal, interagency effort implemented by
President Obama that focused on closing and eliminating the opportunity
gaps faced by boys and young men of color to give all young people the
chance to reach their full potential.

Evaluation & Research

CHSR worked with Albany schools to identify performance measures to
track both implementation fidelity and outcomes of the MBKCG initiative.
The evaluation assessed literacy achievement for students in
prekindergarten through grade 3, tracked the achievement gap between
students of color and their peers, and examined frequency and outcomes
of Code of Conduct violations in Priority Schools.
