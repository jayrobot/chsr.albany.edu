and [**[Department for Children, Youth, and

Evaluation & Research

The evaluation conducted by CHSR aimed to provide county leadership with
an assessment of the operations of six county-level human services
departments. Utilizing a comprehensive document review, interviews with
departmental leaders, and a staff survey, CHSR developed an
organizational structure of each department, logic models to outline
departmental goals and objectives, and benchmark measures to assist
departments in monitoring outcomes on a yearly basis. Additionally, the
evaluation gathered data and feedback regarding each department's
engagement in activities designed to increase equity among the residents
of Albany County. This data was to be used by the county to develop a
strategic plan related to a county-wide equity agenda.
