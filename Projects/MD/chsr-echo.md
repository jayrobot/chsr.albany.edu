**ECHO Collaborative**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) performed an early
evaluation of the end+disparities **[[ECHO
Collaborative](https://targethiv.org/cqii/end-disparities-echo-collaborative)]{.underline}**
to assess implementation of the initiative and early results of
participation on organizational improvement.

The end+disparities ECHO Collaborative, led by the [**Health Resources
and Services Administration (HRSA)**](https://ryanwhite.hrsa.gov/) Ryan
White HIV/AIDS Program and New York State Department of Health's AIDS
Institute, aimed to reduce disparities in HIV patient outcomes and
treatment by training participating organization in continuous quality
improvement (CQI) practices and supporting the development of a peer
network of providers.

Evaluation & Research

The evaluation conducted by CHSR included secondary data review;
in-depth interviews with a sample of organizations; and a survey of all
involved partners regarding current level of involvement, first
successes and challenges to CQI project implementation, and utilization
of the peer network. This work gave Collaborative leadership early
insight as to whether the program is starting to achieve the desired
impact on patient outcomes and identified common routes to these
results, in addition to identifying groups that may need more support to
make expected progress, thereby informing the second half of the
initiative's efforts.
