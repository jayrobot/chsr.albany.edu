**The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD)**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) collaborated with the New
York State **[[Office of Children and Family
Services](http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/research-data-technology/reporting-systems/nytd)
(OCFS)]{.underline}** to track and interview youth transitioning out of
foster care in accordance with the congressionally-mandated,
country-wide [**[National Youth in Transition Database
(NYTD)]{.underline}**](http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/research-data-technology/reporting-systems/nytd)
initiative.

Evaluation & Research

For the project, CHSR collected information on youth in foster care and
their outcomes as they transitioned out of foster care. The survey
focused on employment, education, financial resources, and family
relationships. CHSR tracked and surveyed these youth at ages 17, 19, and
21 years old.

The project required close communication with regional, district, and
voluntary agency casework and administrative staff to obtain youth data,
as well as ongoing contact with youth to maintain current contact
information. Surveys are administered via phone, web, and paper
surveying techniques and data files are regularly submitted to OCFS for
federal submission and approval.
