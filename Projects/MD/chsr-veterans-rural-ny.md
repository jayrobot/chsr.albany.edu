**Assessment of Health Services for**

**Veterans in Rural Upstate New York**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) worked with
the [**[Veterans Administration (VA) Health Care Upstate New
York ]{.underline}**](http://www.visn2.va.gov/)to identify potential
non-VA collaborators and models of care that were in place or could be
implemented to improve access to services for veterans in rural areas of
the state.

The Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) of upstate New York,
included six medical centers (located in Albany, Batavia, Bath, Buffalo,
Canandaigua, and Syracuse) and 29 community based outpatient clinics
(CBOC\'s) in 49 counties.

Evaluation & Research

CHSR conducted a review of extant research on evidence-based models of
care for improving health service delivery in rural areas. The review
informed the development of an online survey for all medical center
directors and community-based outpatient clinic managers. The survey
provided a baseline assessment of current rural community collaborations
and referral practices and identified perceived barriers to and benefits
of collaborations with non-VA providers.
