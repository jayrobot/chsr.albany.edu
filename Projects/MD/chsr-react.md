**Re-Rentering the Albany Community**

**Through Treatment (REACT) Evaluation**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) worked with
the **[[Addictions Care Center of Albany](http://theacca.net/)
(ACCA)]{.underline}** and other community providers to evaluate
Re-Entering the Albany Community through Treatment (REACT).

REACT, which was supported by the **[[Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration](https://www.samhsa.gov/)
(SAMHSA)]{.underline}**, provided education, case management, and
integrated treatment for the substance abusing offender population
reentering the community.

Evaluation & Research

The evaluation conducted by CHSR collected, analyzed, and reported on
data from structured interviews and client focus groups. The evaluation
provided data on project implementation; achievement of client and
program goals and objectives; adherence to treatment model fidelity; the
level of client satisfaction; and assessment of cultural competence,
quality assurance and regulatory controls.
