**Albany School Improvement Grant Program Evaluation**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) was contracted to evaluate
the Albany School Improvement Grant (SIG) initiative which aimed to
support school improvement efforts at Focus and Priority Schools in the
[**City School District of Albany**](https://www.albanyschools.org/).

Evaluation & Research

The evaluation CHSR conducted of SIG consisted of a process and outcome
study. The process study focused on examining program practices,
including how programs operate, who is served, what services are
provided, and barriers to implementation. The outcome evaluation
examined whether programs were meeting desired goals and measurable
outcomes. The evaluation analyzed data from records maintained by
SIG-supported programs and data entered into Power School and the
Violent and Disruptive Incident Report (VADIR) database. These data were
used to address questions related to characteristics of participating
students, such as demographics, grades, scores on assessments, student
behavior, and the frequency, intensity, and duration of program
participation.

Other data collection strategies, including teacher, parent, and student
surveys, were utilized as appropriate. CHSR provided data support,
aiming to assist program administrators in defining concrete goals and
collecting appropriately targeted program measures.Â CHSR also analyzed
ongoing district surveys (lottery survey, YRBS, etc.) to measure program
effects and inform program development.
