**Addressing the Needs of Victims of**

**Domestic Violence in Housing Programs**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) collaborated with
**[[Unity
House]{.underline}](https://www.unityhouseny.org/), [[Equinox]{.underline}](https://www.equinoxinc.org/)**,
and the **[[YWCA of Northeastern New
York](http://www.ywca-neny.org/)]{.underline}** on a project, funded by
the New York State [**Office of Victim Services**](https://ovs.ny.gov/),
which was developed to address the critical behavioral health needs
experienced by victims of domestic violence residing in domestic
violence housing. The project focused on expanding access to
low-barrier, voluntary behavioral health services for victims of
domestic violence residing in domestic violence housing programs by
hiring co-located and/or mobile licensed mental health professionals.

Evaluation & Research

The evaluation conducted by CHSR consisted of three principal
components:

-   a **Needs Assessment** to examine each agency's current services,
    further identify contextually-relevant practice gaps, and
    triangulate stakeholder perspectives regarding needs and barriers;

-   an **Implementation Evaluation** to determine the extent to which
    the project is being implemented as designed, and to identify
    factors that are facilitating or impeding successful implementation;
    and

-   an **Outcome Evaluation** focused on assessing changes in staff
    behavior, housing and service delivery, and agency practice that
    have resulted from the project.
