**Coordinated Children's Service Initiative Evaluation**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) conducted a mixed-methods
evaluation of the Coordinated Children's Service Initiative (CCSI). CCSI
began in the 1990s as a multi-agency approach to reduce out-of-home
placements of children with emotional disabilities by creating locally
coordinated systems of care.

CCSI was based on the belief that there had been an over-reliance on
out-of-home residential placements, the most restrictive and expensive
form of treatment. Instead, CCSI was designed to promote community-based
alternatives that support the care of children in families and
family-like settings.

Evaluation & Research

CHSR conducted on-site structured interviews with participants in eight
counties that implemented CCSI in its earliest stages. Additionally,
CHSR analyzed placement data from the child welfare, education, juvenile
justice, and mental health residential placement systems. CCSI counties
were compared with non-CCSI counties to examined changes in placements
over time, changes in placements by service system, and the potential
cost savings of averted placements. The study culminated in a report to
the [**[New York State Council on Children and
Families]{.underline}**](http://ccf.ny.gov/) that described CCSI's
strengths and challenges, provided some evidence that CCSI contributed
to declines in out-of-home placements for participating children, and
offered a series of recommendations to guide future practice.
