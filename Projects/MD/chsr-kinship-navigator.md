**Kinship Navigator**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) received a grant from
the [**[New York State Kinship
Navigator]{.underline}**](http://www.nysnavigator.org/) program to
evaluate multiple interventions for kinship caregivers (e.g.,
grandparent, relative, or fictive kin caregivers).

Both interventions focused on fostering family stability, safety,
well-being, and permanency for youth in kinship care. One intervention
provided case management and referral services through a warmline. The
other provided local case management and peer-to-peer support group
services.

Evaluation & Research

The study performed by CHSR included a formative evaluation, which will
examine program operations, data collection capacity, and options for
drawing a comparison group. A process evaluation was then conducted to
determine the extent to which services are being delivered as designed,
and to develop knowledge about implementation that can foster future
replication. The process evaluation assessed if and how the
interventions changed child welfare practice; how various kinship
stakeholders collaborate; and factors that facilitated or impeded
successful implementation. Finally, an outcome evaluation was conducted
to assess program impacts on key child and caregiver outcomes, including
child well-being, caregiver well-being, family stress, and child
permanency.
