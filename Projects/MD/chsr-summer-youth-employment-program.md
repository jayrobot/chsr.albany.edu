**Evaluation of the Summer Youth Employment Program**

The Center for Human Services Research partnered with the [City of
Albany\'s Learning, Initiative and Gaining Headway Together (LIGHT) to
develop surveys and analyze educational data for the Summer Youth
Employment Program
(SYEP)](https://www.albanyny.gov/Government/Departments/YouthandWorkforceServices/SummerYouthEmploymentProgram.aspx).
