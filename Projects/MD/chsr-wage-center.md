**The Wage Center Evaluation**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) performed an evaluation of
[**[The WAGE Center]{.underline}**](http://www.albanyhousing.org/) for
theÂ **[[Albany Housing Authority](http://www.albanyhousing.org/)
(AHA)]{.underline}**.

The WAGE Center continued AHA's focus on the core services that
maximized the ability of residents to access opportunities that lead to
self-sufficiency and supplemented these core services with an array of
educational, training and support opportunities provided by other
partners. The program focused on AHA residents and Housing Choice
Voucher participants receiving Temporary Assistance to Needy Families
(TANF).

Evaluation & Research

The evaluation conducted by CHSR consisted of a process study and an
outcome study. The process study identified the numbers and
characteristics of the participant population and the nature of services
being provided. The outcome study investigated whether the programs
operating under the WAGE Center were achieving the goals of reducing
barriers to employment, developing participant self-sufficiency, and
increasing the employment of individuals being served.
