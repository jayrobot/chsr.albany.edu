**Housing Needs of Grandfamilies**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) was awarded a contract by
the Division of Housing and Community Renewal to conduct a qualitative
study on housing in relation to grandparent and elderly relative
caregivers of children.

Evaluation & Research

The evaluation conducted by CHSR focused on contextualizing existing
state data on grandfamilies and housing cost, and to make connections
between identified needs in grandfamily housing and existing
infrastructures for affordable low-and moderate-income housing in New
York State. Evaluation activities included:

1.  a review of relevant applied research and scholarly literature on
    grandparents and grandfamily housing;

2.  interviews conducted with experienced program professionals at
    statewide, regional and/or local levels of New York State Office of
    Children and Family Services (OCFS), Office of Temporary and
    Disability Assistance (OTDA), and the State Office for the Aging
    (SOFA);

3.  interviews conducted with directors of local kinship care programs
    and coalitions across the state;

4.  administration of focus groups with children and grandparent and
    elderly relative caregivers reflecting diverse distribution of
    grandfamilies around the state; and

5.  generation of a report summarizing the findings and making
    recommendations derived fromÂ [**[these
