**MRT Supportive Housing Initiative**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) was awarded a grant by
the **[[New York State Department of Health](https://www.health.ny.gov/)
(NYSDOH)]{.underline}** to conduct an evaluation to assess the
implementation, impact, effectiveness and cost savings of a [**[Medicaid
Redesign Team (MRT) Supportive Housing
Initiative]{.underline}**](https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/redesign/supportive_housing_initiatives.htm).

NYSDOH launched the MRT Supportive Housing Initiative, a pilot program
to identify best practices, procedures and methods for supportive
housing providers to collaborate with Health Homes to identify and
locate homeless or unstably housed Health Home members and to provide
housing as a means to facilitate access to health services and improve
the health status of Health Home members.

Evaluation & Research

CHSR was contracted by NYSDOH to lead an evaluation team to evaluate and
report on the impact, effectiveness, and cost savings of the MRT
Supportive Housing initiative. The evaluation team consisted of CHSR,
the [**[Institute for Health Systems Evaluation (at the UAlbany School
of Public
Health)]{.underline}**](https://www.albany.edu/sph/institute-for-health-system-evaluation.php),
and [**[CARES, Inc.]{.underline}**](http://caresny.org/) The evaluation
included a process study, a cost study, and a study of quality-of-life
outcomes for program participants.
