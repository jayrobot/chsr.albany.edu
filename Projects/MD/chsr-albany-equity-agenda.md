**Albany County Equity Agenda**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) assistedÂ [**[Albany
County]{.underline}**](http://www.albanycounty.com/) in developing an
Equity Agenda Strategic Plan to assist Albany County in developing a
county-wide equity agenda.

Evaluation & Research

CHSR gathered and analyzed county-wide data to identify areas of
inequity related to service provision and workforce representation.
Through a collaboration with Dr. Salome Raheim from the University at
Albany School of Social Welfare, CHSR provided training and technical
assistance to assist Albany County department leadership in defining
goals and strategies to address the underlying causes of inequities
within the county. The goal of this project was to develop a strategic
plan that would reduce barriers in service provision, facilitate the
creation of a more representative county workforce, and further identify
areas of focus.
