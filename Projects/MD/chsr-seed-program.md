**SEED Program Evaluation**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) conducted an evaluation of
the Small Enterprise Economic Development (SEED) program.

The SEED program was a "character-based" lending program with the goal
of supporting and financing entrepreneurs who had been unable to obtain
the resources necessary to start or expand a small business through
traditional sources. The program operated as a partnership between
Empire State Development, the University at Albany, and the State
Employees Federal Credit Union (SEFCU). The program offered
entrepreneurs support and mentorship, as well as loans of up to \$35,000
that were approved using a character-based criteria system.

Evaluation & Research

CHSR focused on a formative evaluation approach that focused on
identification of process strengths and continuous improvement. CHSR
sought to examine how SEED impacted several stakeholders with potential
to benefit from the program: fledgling entrepreneurs, economic
developers, and lenders.
