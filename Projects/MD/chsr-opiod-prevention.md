**Greater Rochester Opioid Prevention**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) was awarded a grant
by [**[The Greater Rochester Health
Foundation ]{.underline}**](http://www.thegrhf.org/)to conduct an
evaluation to assess the implementation, impact, and effectiveness of an
opioid prevention project in Genesee, Orleans, and Wyoming counties.

The Greater Rochester Health Foundation (GRHF) funded a collaborative
program implemented and managed by the [**[Genesee/Orleans Council on
Alcoholism and Substance Abuse
(GCASA)]{.underline}**](https://gcasa.net/) to improve follow up
services for people who use opioids after overdose or other medical
emergency.

CHSR led a collaborative team including the Center for Addictions
Research and an Albany Medical Center physician-research focused on
evaluating and reporting the impact and effectiveness of this prevention
program. The evaluation included a mixed methods process study and
outcomes study that utilized both qualitative and quantitative data.
