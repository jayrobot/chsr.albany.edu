**Innovations in Victim Services**

**for Underserved Populations**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) was contracted by the New
York State Office of Victim Services (NYS OVS) to identify innovative
programs and practices that reach underserved crime victims. This work
was the first step in a larger project to enhance the provision of
services to underserved victims in New York State.

Evaluation & Research

The research conducted by CHSR focused on programs that had reached, or
could be adapted to increasing access to, the following underserved
populations:

-   young men of color,

-   transgender individuals,

-   the elderly, and

-   deaf/hard of hearing individuals.

These populations were identified as underserved (and in need of
services) in an earlier [**[needs
assessment]{.underline}**](https://www.albany.edu/chsr/Publications/Civil%20Legal%20Needs%20booklet%202017_pages.pdf) of
crime victims in New York State and after consultation with [**[NYS
OVS]{.underline}**](https://ovs.ny.gov/). CHSR conducted a literature
review of programs and practices, followed by interviews with
jurisdictions where innovations were implemented. A final report was
prepared that described the innovations and provided recommendations to
enhance the provision of services to underserved victims in New York
State.
