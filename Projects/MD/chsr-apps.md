**Adolescent Pregnancy & Prevention Services**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR), in collaboration with the
New York State **[[Office of Children and Family
Services](http://www.ocfs.state.ny.us/main/),]{.underline}** developed a
customized web-based application for the Adolescent Pregnancy and
Prevention Services (APPS) program.

The APPS program was developed to provide a comprehensive array of
services to at-risk, pregnant, and parenting adolescents through 21
years of age. The program was designed to address four outcomes
statewide: adolescent pregnancy prevention, coordination/community
awareness, self-sufficiency, and healthy child development.

Systems & Software development

CHSR transitioned the APPS database from a site-specific Access database
to a statewide web-based application. CHSR programmed the application,
converted data from the old system to the new system, trained users, and
provided technical support. The new system met administrative,
programmatic, reporting, and evaluation needs. The web-based system
allowed managers and workers to analyze and advance practice through its
comprehensive data collection capacity and sophisticated reporting
mechanisms. It also allowed individual sites to see their progress
towards their annual performance and contractual targets.
