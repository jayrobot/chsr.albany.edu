**Rural Law Initiative Collaboration**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) contracted with the
Government Law Center at Albany Law School in a project to understand
the dearth of available legal services in rural areas. This project was

Law
Initiative]{.underline}**](http://www.albanylaw.edu/centers/government-law-center) and [**[SUNY
Cobleskill's Institute for Rural
Vitality]{.underline}**](http://www.cobleskill.edu/institute/).

CHSR designed, dissemination, and analyzed a multi-mode survey of
attorneys in rural New York to inform the current status of rural legal
practice.
