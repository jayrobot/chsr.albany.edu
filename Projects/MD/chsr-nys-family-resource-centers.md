**New York State Family Resource Centers**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) partnered with the New
York State [**[Office of Children and Family
Services]{.underline}**](http://www.ocfs.state.ny.us/main/) to gather
data to support the activities and services of Family Resource Centers
(FRCs) located throughout New York State.

FRCs offered voluntary services and support for families in their
communities, with an emphasis on families with young children. They were
diverse in their program offerings and populations served, but all
promoted the strengthening of families through developing social
support, increasing knowledge of effective parenting, fostering child
development, and enhancing family functioning. Services included parent
education classes and workshops, playgroups, information and referral
services, family social and recreational programs, supervised
visitation, adult education (e.g., job readiness, English as a Second
Language programs), counseling, home visiting, early childhood
education, and concrete services (e.g., food and clothing).

Evaluation & Research

CHSR undertook a number of studies to examine the implementation and
outcomes of the FRCs:

-   an **Outcome Study** that assessed the effectiveness of FRCs in
    enhancing parenting behaviors and attitudes and increasing social
    support;

-   a **Community Study** examined the connections between FRCs and
    their communities. These connections were investigated through
    interviews with people at other organizations that provided services
    to the same target population of children and families;

-   a **Dosage Analysis** explored patterns of program attendance and
    retention based on participant demographics and site
    characteristics;

-   a **Protective Factors Survey** was administered to FRC participants
    at regular intervals. CHSR helped develop the survey to provide
    ongoing information about participants' family functioning, social
    support, concrete support, nurturing and attachment, and knowledge
    of child development. CHSR analyzed the data periodically; and

-   a **Satisfaction Survey** developed for FRCs to use to assess
    participants' experience of [**[The Incredible
    Years]{.underline}**](http://www.incredibleyears.com/) parent
    education curriculum.

Systems & Software development

CHSR developed a web-based database application for FRCs to assist in
monitoring activities, tracking participation, administrating programs,
and measuring outcomes.
