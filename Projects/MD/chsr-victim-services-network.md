**Victim Legal Assistance Network Development**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) collaborated
with [**[Empire Justice Center
(EJC)]{.underline}**](http://www.empirejustice.org/), and [**[Pro Bono
Net (PBN)]{.underline}**](http://www.probono.net/), on the Victim Legal
Assistance Network Development, a grant funded by the New York State
Office of Victim Services.

This project was a continuation of a federal grant from the Department
of Justice, Office for Victims of Crime. The goal of the federally
funded project was to develop a comprehensive, collaborative network to
meet the civil legal needs of crime victims in New York State, outside
of New York City. This continuation sought to expand and enhance the
information and resources available on the [**[New York Crime Victims
Legal Help Network]{.underline}**](https://crimevictimshelpny.org/).

Evaluation & Research

CHSR conducted the following evaluation activities to inform the
development of the Legal Help Network:

-   an analysis of data on crime and victim services;

-   a review of existing programs and services across New York State;

-   a survey of victims and service providers; and

-   focus groups and interviews with crime victims, service providers,
    and civil legal attorneys.

CHSR then conducted a needs assessment of specific victim populations,
obtained feedback about how victims and service providers used the
Network, and analyzed data to inform modifications to the Network.
