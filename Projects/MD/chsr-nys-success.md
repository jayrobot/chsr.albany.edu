**New York State Success**

The Center for Human Services Research (CHSR) conducted an evaluation of
the New York State Success (NYS Success) project which was designed to
bring the [System of
Care](http://www.tapartnership.org/systemsOfCare.php/) approach to scale
across New York State through the provision of training and technical
assistance, with the goal of creating a sustainable service-delivery
infrastructure that incorporates System of Care values, principles, and
practices.

The project was a statewide System of Care expansion grant which began
in 2012 and was funded by the [**[Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration
(SAMHSA)]{.underline}**](http://www.samhsa.gov/). The purpose of the
project was to improve the behavioral health outcomes of children and
youth with serious emotional disturbances and their families.

Evaluation & Research

The evaluation conducted by CHSR consisted of the following key
components:

1.  **Federal Data Requirements (Infrastructure and Youth-Level Outcome
    Data):** To ensure compliance with federal mandates, CHSR collected
    quarterly surveys to assess infrastructure changes that occurred
    within the counties as a result of NYS Success. The survey collected
    such data as county policy changes; changes in the number of
    agencies and organizations collaborating, coordinating, and sharing
    resource; and changes in the number and percentage of youth and
    family members serving on workgroups, advisory groups, or councils.
    Individual youth-level data were collected at six-month intervals
    using an instrument designed to measure mental health symptoms,
    substance use, school functioning, and other outcomes of interest.

2.  **Process Studies and Formative Evaluations:**  CHSR conducted
    process studies and formative evaluations on topics of interest to
    NYS Success stakeholders to provide feedback to inform continuous
    quality improvement and development of new project initiatives. CHSR
    conducted one such formative evaluation on the implementation of
    Wraparound in New York State, an intensive care coordination process
    in children's mental health, to inform the design of a pilot
    project.

3.  **County-Specific Evaluation:** CHSR worked intensively in several
    counties on county-specific evaluation activities to inform their
    local System of Care efforts.

4.  **Wraparound Pilot Project:** CHSR designed and implemented an
    evaluation of the Wraparound pilot project, which consisted of
    process and outcomes studies designed to capture stakeholder
    perspectives on Wraparound training, coaching, and overall
    implementation, as well as fidelity to the Wraparound approach. The
    outcomes study was designed to assess early outcomes of Wraparound,
    using a pre-post, matched comparison design. Data sources included
    Medicaid claims data, juvenile detention placement data, and school
    data.
